00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,271
After choosing the cloud service model and the cloud type offered by vendors, customers

1
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:15,410
need to plan the infrastructure architecture.

2
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,400
The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,550
This layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,550
Centers.

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,100
A Cloud provider’s IT environment is typically distributed across many Regions around the

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
world.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,010
A cloud Region, is a geographic area or location where a Cloud provider’s infrastructure

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,489
is clustered, and may have names like NA South or US East.

9
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:48,190
The cloud Regions are isolated from each other so that if one Region was impacted by a natural

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,690
disaster like an Earthquake, the Cloud operations in other Regions would keep running.

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,520
Each Cloud Region can have multiple Zones (or Availability Zones or AZ for short), which

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,770
are typically distinct Data Centers with their own power, cooling and networking resources.

13
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,680
These Zones can have names like DAL-09 or us-east-1.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,480
The isolation of zones improves the cloud’s overall fault tolerance, decreases latency,

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,330
and avoids creating a single shared point of failure.

16
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:29,310
The Availability Zones (and DataCenters within them) are connected to other AZs and regions,

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,860
private datacenters and the Internet using very high bandwidth network connectivity.

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,940
A cloud Data center is a huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure.

19
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,310
These data centers contain pods and racks or standardized containers of computing resources

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,760
such as servers, as well as storage, and networking equipment - virtually everything that a physical

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,430
IT environment has.

22
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,590
Computing Resources: Cloud providers offer several compute options

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,490
– Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and “Serverless” computing resources.

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,700
Most of the servers in a cloud datacenter run hypervisors to create virtual servers

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,800
or virtual machines (also called VMs for short), that are software-based computers, based on

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,030
virtualization technologies.

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,690
Other servers in the racks are bare metal servers that are physical servers that aren’t

28
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,780
virtualized.

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,010
Customers can provision VMs and Bare Metals servers as and when they need them and run

30
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,590
their workloads on them.

31
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,530
Cloud users can also run their workloads on serverless computing resources, which are

32
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,140
an abstraction layer on top of virtual machines.

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,790
We will talk about all three compute options in greater detail in subsequent videos.

34
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,660
Storage: Information and data can consist of files,

35
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,250
code, documents, images, videos, backups, snapshots, and databases and can be stored

36
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,540
in many different types of storage options on the Cloud.

37
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,510
Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers are provisioned with default storage in local

38
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,569
drives.

39
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,490
Since these cloud servers can be provisioned and decommissioned by customers on demand

40
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,690
and freed up for use by other users, any information stored in a local drive can be lost when you

41
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,700
delete or decommission a cloud server.

42
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,940
However there are other storage options available on the cloud to persist data that you can

43
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,310
choose depending on factors like how important your data is, how quickly you want to be able

44
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,810
to access it, how often you access it, and how secure you need it to be.

45
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,900
These additional storage options include Block storage, File storage, and Object storage.

46
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,650
Block and file storage modes are commonly used in traditional data centers, but “often

47
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,190
struggle with scale, performance and distributed characteristics of cloud.”

48
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,520
Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud as it’s both highly

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,989
distributed and resilient.

50
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,170
We will examine Object Storage and the other storage options in more detail in later videos.

51
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,989
Networking: Networking infrastructure in a cloud datacenter

52
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,930
includes traditional networking hardware like routers and switches, but more importantly

53
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,680
for users of the Cloud, the Cloud providers have Software Defined Networking (or SDN)

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,969
options where certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programmatically,

55
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,059
through APIs.

56
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:39,550
This allows for easier network provisioning, configuration, and management in the cloud.

57
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,039
When servers in the cloud are provisioned, you need to setup their public and private

58
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:45,620
network interfaces.

59
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,949
The public network interfaces, as the name suggests, connect the servers to the public

60
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,129
internet, whereas the private ones provide connectivity to your other cloud resources

61
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,949
and help keep them secure.

62
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:04,419
As in the physical IT world, network interfaces in the cloud need to have IP addresses and

63
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,310
subnets either assigned automatically or configured.

64
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,259
In a cloud environment it is even more important to configure which network traffic and users

65
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:19,849
can access your resources, which can be done by setting up Security Groups and Access Control

66
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,249
Lists (or ACLs).

67
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:26,970
For further security and isolation of your resources in the cloud, most Cloud providers

68
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:34,401
provide Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and Virtual

69
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,099
Private Networks (VPNs).

70
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:43,120
Some of the traditional hardware appliances such as firewalls, load balancers, gateways

71
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,080
and traffic analyzers can also be virtualized and made available as services in the cloud.

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,589
Another networking capability provided by the Cloud Providers is Content Delivery Networks

73
00:05:54,589 --> 00:06:00,770
or CDNs, that distribute content to multiple points throughout the world so users accessing

74
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,869
the content can access it more quickly by getting it from a point nearest to them.

75
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:11,029
We will learn more about some of these cloud networking options and terminology in subsequent

76
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,029
videos.

77
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,740
Cloud infrastructure is constantly advancing and improving.

78
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:28,610
In the next video, we explain virtualization and virtual machines.
