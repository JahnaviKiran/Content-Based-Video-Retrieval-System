in today's session we will be talking

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,759
about the most brimming topic of the r

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,519
the recommendation engine and how it

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,480
works

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,240
without wasting any more time let's

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
quickly jump into this video

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,680
what do you think when the word

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920
recommendation comes to your mind

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
imagine a scenario where one of your

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
closest friends recommends you to watch

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
money heist on netflix or your sister

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,079
wants you to watch friends and your

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
mother wants you to spend some time

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,000
watching a planet documentary

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
are these recommendations based upon

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
what they like or what you like

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,879
the question is pretty relevant however

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,719
what if there is someone who understands

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
your choice and recommends something you

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,079
want to watch

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
well that's today's topic recommendation

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,160
engine

recommendation engine

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
what is a recommender system

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,479
in today's digital world where people

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,080
spend most of their time watching

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
netflix or amazon prime the

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
recommendation system is the most potent

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
marketing tool a recommender system is

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
nothing fancy but an automated

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,680
information filtering system to filter

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
some entities composed of machine

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
learning and ai algorithm which predicts

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
what the customer wants to see

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
these entities can be any possible

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
products such as ads movies tv shows

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,439
songs and so on which we see on apps

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
like netflix amazon and youtube on every

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
day

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
today the e-commerce space is loaded

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,159
with information with hundreds of movies

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,240
and shows released every day a

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,320
recommendation system helps tackle this

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880
challenge and saves customers a lot of

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
time while browsing the internet

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,119
the recommendation system automatically

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
directs the user to the product they

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
will mainly like

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,280
now let us understand this via example

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
say we watched a movie today and then

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
later we got recommendations for some

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
different movies based on previous

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
viewing history

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
other than movies it could also be a

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,959
product that we bought and then we get a

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
recommendation for a similar product

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
based on the power of previous viewing

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
history

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
note the recommender system not only

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,400
works in what products are being shown

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
but also in what order the products are

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,599
being ranked

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
the idea of a recommendation engine is

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
not new it is something you are already

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
familiar with

75
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
excited to know

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
do you watch movies on netflix or spend

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
time shopping on amazon or follow the

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,160
recommendation made by youtube for music

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
if yes you are already supporting the

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,560
recommendation system in many aspects

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,879
unknowingly which enhances your online

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,160
experience

83
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
now when you have understood

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,920
recommendation system it is important to

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,159
understand why the recommender system is

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,040
built

87
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,280
without any further ado let's see why

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
this is important

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
imagine what if you are left on netflix

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
between tons of movies to find your

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
favorite one or on youtube to find which

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
song you like the most it will be a

93
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
brainstorming session

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,319
that's exactly why recommendation engine

95
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,599
is important

96
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,239
businesses are showing us recommendation

97
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
and relevant content for a couple of

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,799
reasons for one most companies think

99
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,120
they understand their customer but often

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
customers can behave much differently

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
than businesses you ever think as their

102
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,519
choice fluctuate with time

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,920
so it's important to show the users what

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
is relevant to them and match their

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,319
choices while also sharing new content

106
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
which might grab their attention

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
as mentioned earlier the internet is

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,560
flooded with good content

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
therefore you need a tool that

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
bifurcates your choices from the hoard

111
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
of information present on the internet

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
today the recommendation system serves

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
to help us solve the information

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
overload problem and helps us narrow

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,120
down the set of choices

116
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
it helps businesses sell more relevant

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
content that might attract users and

118
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
make them stick forever

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,519
from the customer's perspective the

120
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
recommender system helps save valuable

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
time and showcases what interests the

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
user

123
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,680
however from a business perspective it

124
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,238
helps to understand better what the user

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,880
wants and might want in the near future

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
so how does the recommendation engine

127
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
work

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
now when you have understood exactly

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
what the recommendation engine is and

130
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
why it is necessary today let us

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
understand how it works how does the

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
recommender system work

133
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
imagine you like your pizza with tomato

134
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
toppings how does your mom know that you

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
like tomatoes on your pizza

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
the best and the easiest way is that she

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
could have asked you specifically if you

138
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
want tomatoes or she must have washed

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
you from a distance while ordering

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
pizzas a recommended engine is nothing

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
different instead it almost works the

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,639
same way

143
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
it will either ask you what you

144
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,479
preferred or see what kind of content

145
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
you are regularly watching

146
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
say you like family shows then it will

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
mostly recommend similar content which

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
will hook you to watch more and even if

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
your mom knows you well maybe a machine

150
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
learning algorithm knows your choices

151
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,320
even better

152
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,880
for example when you go to netflix or

153
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
any other services which are mostly

154
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
based on recommendation the first time

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,120
you go there they ask you what your

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
taste buds are

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
whether you prefer horror shows or

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
comedy series have you ever thought the

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
reason behind this

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
well it's to understand what the user

161
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
may like and recommend the same to grab

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
the interest in the very first go as

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,479
they are completely clueless about your

164
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,400
choice as they have never interacted

165
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
with you personally or digitally

166
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
for any service you are a valuable asset

167
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
therefore they are bound to be treated

168
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
like king and queens

169
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
it's called the cold start problem where

170
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
they have no idea of who you are and

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
have no profile for you therefore they

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
will force you to at least put in

173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
something say what movies you like what

174
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
are your food choices what singer you

175
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,520
must love the most what genre grabs your

176
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
attention because how will they know

177
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
otherwise

178
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
let us understand how youtube

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
recommendations work

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
youtube videos are mainly dependent on

181
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
three factors

182
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
watch time videos that have a lot of

183
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,800
watch time then engagement and finally

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
topic relevance which means the video is

185
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,759
relevant to topic i am looking for

186
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,919
another factor that plays a vital role

187
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,080
in video recommendation is the user's

188
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,120
history

189
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,039
say you continuously watch a particular

190
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
youtube channel you will regularly

191
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
recommend videos of them and content

192
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,199
similar to theirs

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
if i watch a trailer of avengers end

194
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,199
game the stakes are high that i'll

195
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,680
recommend the trailer of iron man or

196
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
behind the scenes of avengers endgame

197
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,720
note these algorithms are supremely

198
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
smart which know what to show you when

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
and they can be highly accurate

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
it should also be noted that there are

201
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
higher chances that each company

202
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
including youtube or amazon might have

203
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
its own recommendation engines or a

204
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,440
specific way of generating

205
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,000
recommendations as one company's method

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
of recommendation might not apply to

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
another company or all

208
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,280
what are the different types of

209
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
recommendation engine

210
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,599
before understanding how the netflix and

211
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
amazon recommendation engine works it is

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
important to understand the different

213
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
types of recommendation engines

214
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
broadly the recommendation engines are

215
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
divided into two parts collaborative

216
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,880
filtering collaborative filtering is a

217
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
type of recommendation engine which

218
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,280
majorly focuses on understanding and

219
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
analyzing the customer's behavior

220
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
preferences or activities to suggest

221
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,319
reliable product or services

222
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,479
you're a large part of information is

223
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
collected depending on a customer

224
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
preference to see what the customer

225
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,599
might like

226
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,840
amazon is one of the biggest examples of

227
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
collaborative filtering as it works on

228
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,840
collecting preferences from distinct

229
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
sources

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
techniques involved in collaborative

231
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
filtering non-probabilistic algorithm

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,879
user based nearest neighbor item-based

233
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
nearest neighbor

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,639
reducing dimensionality

235
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,440
next up probabilistic algorithm

236
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,120
bcn network model em algorithm content

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,680
based system the content based system

238
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
deals with the idea of if you like a

239
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
particular product you will like the

240
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,879
similar products too here the machine

241
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
learning algorithm suggests products

242
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
that are similar to the user's history

243
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
for example if a person likes horror

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
movies the system will recommend movies

245
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,320
from the same genre repeatedly how does

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
netflix recommendation work

247
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,320
the success of netflix is mostly

248
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,799
dependent on the recommendation engine

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,200
whatever they do is based upon what the

250
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
recommendation engine suggests

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
record says 80 of people who play on

252
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
netflix comes from netflix

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,399
recommendation algorithm so it's really

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
big level for netflix

255
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
in a world where there are so many

256
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
cultures and people with different

257
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
tastes it's hard to please everyone at

258
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
the right time with the right content

259
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
and that's where recommendation engine

260
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
enters

261
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
here is the science behind netflix

262
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,279
whenever you click on the netflix tab

263
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,360
the recommendation system gets ready to

264
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,800
direct you to the right source of

265
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
information you might be looking for

266
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
netflix estimates your action based upon

267
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,240
your number of factors including your

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
interaction with the services say your

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
search history or your most recently

270
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
watched showed other members who have

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200
similar taste or presence as of you

272
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
information about the title such as the

273
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,080
genre you most likely to watch in actors

274
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
you love the most categories and so on

275
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
in addition to know what you love

276
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
watching on netflix they personalize

277
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,680
your experience based upon the time you

278
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
watch netflix the device on which you

279
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,839
are watching netflix for how long you

280
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
are watching netflix in the entire day

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,200
or one sitting

282
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
all these pieces of data may not matter

283
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,399
to you however they are most important

284
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
source of information by which netflix

285
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,399
knows you better than everyone

286
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,320
when you create your profile on netflix

287
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
for very first time you must have

288
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
noticed that netflix asks you to choose

289
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
a title you prefer over others once you

290
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
start to select the options the netflix

291
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
recommendation engine starts to

292
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
bifurcate your choices and presents you

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
with everything you would want to watch

294
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
apart from netflix another platform that

295
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
is gaining immense popularity these days

296
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
is amazon

297
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
let's discuss how amazon recommendation

298
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,560
engine works

299
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
how does the amazon recommendation

300
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,440
engine work

301
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
amazon being a multi-billion dollar

302
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
estate many emerging companies look up

303
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
to amazon and its magic ingredient which

304
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
made it the world's most visited

305
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
e-commerce website till now

306
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
note amazon heavily believes in data

307
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
driven marketing

308
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,640
if you see something that you like and

309
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
something pops up that matches your

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
preferences understand the

311
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
recommendation engine is working at its

312
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
best and throwing some great results

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
the choice you make on amazon are based

314
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
upon three significant factors including

315
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,079
events rating and filtering

316
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,920
let's start with events

317
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,320
amazon stores and tracks data on all

318
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,519
custom behavior and activity on the site

319
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
every time you search something on the

320
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,240
search bar say you type laptop a record

321
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
of the event is locked in the database

322
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,399
and the entry is stored as something

323
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,600
like user a clicked on x product whether

324
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,680
you like a product add a product to the

325
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
cart or purchase a product your actions

326
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,839
are captured which promotes future

327
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,200
purchases

328
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,839
next on the list is ratings ratings are

329
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
an essential component of every

330
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
e-commerce website including amazon

331
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,920
because it unveils how the customer

332
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,480
feels about the particular product here

333
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
the maximum rating is 5 star so in case

334
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
the user truly loves the product he can

335
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,839
easily give it a 5 star the last in the

336
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,399
list is filtering filtering products are

337
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,440
based upon rating and other user data

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
amazon recommendation engine use three

339
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
types of filtering collaborative

340
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,480
user-based and hybrid approach let's

341
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
discuss each of these collaborative

342
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,519
filtering in collaborative filtering the

343
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
visitors choices are compared to each

344
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,760
other and based upon that they are

345
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
recommended the most suitable product

346
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,959
user based filtering the second one is

347
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,040
user based filtering in which users

348
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,560
browser history cart item purchases and

349
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
likes a significant role before

350
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,320
providing recommendations

351
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
with this we come to the end of our

352
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,240
session now that you have learnt what

353
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,399
the recommendation engine is and its

354
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
functioning we would love to hear your

355
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
views about the same in the comment

356
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,079
section below if you guys have any

357
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,000
queries or questions about what we just

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,519
discussed you can leave them in the

359
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,200
comment section and we will get back to

360
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,920
you

361
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,839
before leaving let's quickly have a

362
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,079
summary of what we discussed today we

363
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
started our today's discussion with the

364
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
recommendation engine where we

365
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
understood the ai algorithm through an

366
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,959
example

367
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,880
then we briefly discussed why the

368
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,600
recommendation engine is so important

369
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
later we talked about how it works and

370
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
various aspects which are taken into

371
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,279
consideration

372
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
in the end we also discuss the amazon

373
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,399
and netflix recommendation engine works
