00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,743
This is Atul from Edureka

3
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:09,500
and welcome to today's topic
of discussion on

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,600
AI vs Machine Learning
vs Deep Learning.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,349
These are the term
which have confused a lot

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,100
of people and if you
too are one among them,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,517
let me resolve it for you.

8
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:21,560
Well artificial intelligence
is a broader umbrella

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,300
under which machine learning

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,200
and deep learning come you
can also see in the diagram

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,455
that even deep learning is
a subset of machine learning

12
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:30,310
so you can say

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,500
that all three of them
the AI the machine learning

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,772
and deep learning are just
the subset of each other.

15
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:38,672
So let's move on and understand

16
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,000
how exactly the differ
from each other.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
So let's start
with artificial intelligence.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,013
The term artificial intelligence

19
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,400
was first coined
in the year 1956.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,300
The concept is pretty old,

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,100
but it has gained
its popularity recently.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,500
But why well,

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,079
the reason is earlier we had
very small amount of data

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,200
the data we had Was not enough
to predict the accurate result,

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,500
but now there's a tremendous
increase in the amount

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,496
of data statistics suggest

27
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:11,800
that by 2020 the accumulated
volume of data will increase

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,400
from 4.4 zettabyte stew
roughly around 44 zettabytes

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,200
or 44 trillion GBs

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,754
of data along with such
enormous amount of data.

31
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:23,400
Now, we have more
advanced algorithm

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
and high-end computing
power and storage

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,480
that can deal with such large
amount of data as a result.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,400
It is expected

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,100
that 70% of Enterprise
will Implement ai

36
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,600
over the next 12 months

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,700
which is up from 40 percent
in 2016 and 51 percent in 2017.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,200
Just for your understanding
what does AI well,

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
it's nothing but a technique

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,200
that enables the machine to act
like humans by replicating

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,700
the behavior and nature
with AI it is possible

42
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,100
for machine to learn
from the experience.

43
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
The machines are just
the responses based

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,600
on new input there
by performing human-like tasks.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,490
Artificial intelligence can
be trained to accomplish

46
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,300
specific tasks by processing
large amount of data

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,163
and recognizing pattern in them.

48
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:08,104
You can consider

49
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,500
that building an artificial
intelligence is like Building

50
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,784
a Church, the first church
took generations to finish.

51
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,138
So most of the workers

52
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,736
were working in it never saw
the final outcome those working

53
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:22,442
on it took pride
in their craft building bricks

54
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,500
and chiseling stone

55
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,100
that was going to be placed
into the great structure.

56
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
So as AI researchers,

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,000
we should think of ourselves
as humble brick makers

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
whose job is to study

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,600
how to build components
example Parts is planners

60
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,776
or learning algorithm
or accept anything

61
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,600
that someday someone
and somewhere will integrate

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
into the intelligent systems
some of the examples

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,400
of artificial intelligence
from our day-to-day life

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,600
our Apple series just playing
computer Tesla self-driving car

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,800
and many more these examples
are based on deep learning

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
and natural language processing.

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Well, this was about what is AI
and how it gains its hype.

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,900
So moving on ahead.

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,076
Let's discuss about machine
learning and see what it is

70
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,965
and white pros of an introduced.

71
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,500
Well Machine learning came

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,200
into existence in the late 80s
and the early 90s,

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,600
but what were the issues
with the people

74
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
which made the machine learning
come into existence?

75
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,017
Let us discuss them one by one
in the field of Statistics.

76
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:19,944
The problem was

77
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:22,600
how to efficiently train
large complex model

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,700
in the field of computer science
and artificial intelligence.

79
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,600
The problem was how to train
more robust version of AI system

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
while in the case

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,355
of Neuroscience problem
faced by the researchers was

82
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:35,650
how to design operation
model of the brain.

83
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,473
So these are some of the issues

84
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,440
which had the largest influence
and led to the existence

85
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,718
of the machine learning.

86
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:44,189
Now this machine learning
shifted its focus

87
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,700
from the symbolic approaches.

88
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,817
It had inherited
from the AI and move

89
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,423
towards the methods and model.

90
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:52,600
It had borrowed from statistics
and probability Theory.

91
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
So let's proceed and see

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
what exactly is
machine learning.

93
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,034
Well Machine learning
is a subset of AI

94
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,900
which The computer to act

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,300
and make data-driven decisions
to carry out a certain task.

96
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
These programs are algorithms
are designed in a way

97
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,300
that they can learn
and improve over time

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,000
when exposed to new data.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
Let's see an example
of machine learning.

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's say you want
to create a system

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,363
which tells the expected weight
of a person based on its side.

102
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:20,899
The first thing you do
is you collect the data.

103
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,056
Let's see there is

104
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,457
how your data looks
like now each point

105
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:27,300
on the graph represent
one data point to start

106
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,947
with we can draw a simple line

107
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,200
to predict the weight
based on the height.

108
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
For example, a simple line

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,800
W equal x minus hundred
where W is waiting kgs

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,700
and edges hide

111
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,900
and centimeter this line can
help us to make the prediction.

112
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,092
Our main goal is
to reduce the difference

113
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:45,764
between the estimated value
and the actual value.

114
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:49,000
So in order to achieve it we
try to draw a straight line

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,596
that fits through all
these different points

116
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,032
and minimize the error.

117
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:55,443
So our main goal is
to minimize the error

118
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:58,700
and make them as small as
possible decreasing the error

119
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,900
or the difference
between In the actual value

120
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,100
and estimated value
increases the performance

121
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,800
of the model further
on the more data points.

122
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,995
We collect the better.

123
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,300
Our model will become we

124
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,700
can also improve our model
by adding more variables

125
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,593
and creating different
production lines for them.

126
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,100
Once the line is created.

127
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,400
So from the next time
if we feed a new data,

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,570
for example height
of a person to the model,

129
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,600
it would easily predict the data
for you and it will tell you

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,300
what has predicted
weight could be.

131
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
I hope you got
a clear understanding

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,200
of machine learning.

133
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,300
So moving on ahead.

134
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,070
Let's learn about deep learning.

135
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,600
Now what is deep learning?

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,999
You can consider deep learning
model as a rocket engine

137
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,298
and its fuel is
its huge amount of data

138
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:39,903
that we feed to
these algorithms the concept

139
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:41,600
of deep learning is not new,

140
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
but recently it's hype as

141
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
increase and deep learning
is getting more attention.

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,282
This field is a particular kind
of machine learning

143
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,400
that is inspired by

144
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,900
the functionality of
our brain cells called neurons

145
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,329
which led to the concept
of artificial neural network.

146
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:56,300
It simply takes

147
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,172
the data connection between all
the artificial neurons

148
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,357
and adjust them according
to the data pattern more neurons

149
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:03,600
are added at the size

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,291
of the data is large
it automatically features

151
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,807
learning at multiple
levels of abstraction.

152
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,315
Thereby allowing a system

153
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:13,331
to learn complex function
mapping without depending

154
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,900
on any specific algorithm.

155
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,493
You know,

156
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:18,000
what no one actually
knows what happens

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,848
inside a neural network
and why it works so well,

158
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,400
so currently you can call
it as a black box.

159
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,000
Let us discuss some
of the example of deep learning

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,900
and understand it
in a better way.

161
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,795
Let me start with a simple
example and explain you

162
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:33,100
how things happen
at a conceptual level.

163
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,823
Let us try and understand

164
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,743
how you recognize a square
from other shapes.

165
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:40,000
The first thing
you do is you check

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,894
whether there are four lines
associated with a figure

167
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,700
or not simple concept, right?

168
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,273
If yes, we further check

169
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,507
if they are connected
and closed again a few years.

170
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:50,565
We finally check

171
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:54,200
whether it is perpendicular
and all its sides are equal,

172
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
correct, if Fulfills.

173
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,300
Yes, it is a square.

174
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, it is nothing but
a nested hierarchy of Concepts

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
what we did here we
took a complex task

176
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,996
of identifying a square

177
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,703
and this case and broken
into simpler tasks.

178
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,517
Now this deep learning
also does the same thing

179
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:11,845
but at a larger scale,

180
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,742
let's take an example
of machine which recognizes

181
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:17,700
the animal the task
of the machine is to recognize

182
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
whether the given image is
of a cat or a dog.

183
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,000
What if we were asked to resolve
the same issue using the concept

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,470
of machine learning
what we would do first.

185
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,400
We would Define
the features such as

186
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,500
check whether the animal has
whiskers are not a check

187
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,000
if the animal has pointed ears

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,500
or not or whether its tail
is straight or curved in short.

189
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,924
We will Define
the facial features and let

190
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:42,000
the system identify which
features are more important

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,265
in classifying a
particular animal now

192
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:48,000
when it comes to deep learning
it takes this to one step ahead

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,823
deep learning automatically
finds out the feature

194
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:53,700
which are most important
for classification compare

195
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,900
into machine learning

196
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,300
where we Had to manually give
out that features by now.

197
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,675
I guess you have understood

198
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:02,100
that AI is a bigger picture
and machine learning

199
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,833
and deep learning or it's apart.

200
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,700
So let's move on

201
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,850
and focus our discussion
on machine learning

202
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,951
and deep learning the easiest
way to understand the difference

203
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:12,800
between the machine learning
and deep learning is to know

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,100
that deep learning is machine
learning more specifically.

205
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,500
It is the next evolution
of machine learning.

206
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,200
Let's take few
important parameter

207
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,600
and compare machine learning
with deep learning.

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,700
So starting with
data dependencies,

209
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,641
the most important difference
between deep learning

210
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,485
and machine learning is
its performance as the volume

211
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,969
of the data gets increased
from the below graph.

212
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,217
You can see that
when the size of the data

213
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:38,399
is small deep learning algorithm
doesn't perform that well,

214
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,900
but why well,

215
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,900
this is because deep
learning algorithm needs

216
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,300
a large amount of data
to understand it perfectly

217
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,908
on the other hand
the machine learning

218
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:51,574
algorithm can easily work
with smaller data set fine.

219
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:55,100
Next comes the hardware
dependencies deep learning.

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,630
Are heavily dependent
on high-end machines

221
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,649
while the machine

222
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,000
learning algorithm can work
on low and machines as well.

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,886
This is because the requirement

224
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:06,274
of deep learning
algorithm include gpus

225
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:07,864
which is an integral part

226
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:11,194
of its working the Deep learning
algorithm requires gpus

227
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:11,800
as they do

228
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,300
a large amount of matrix
multiplication operations,

229
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,100
and these operations

230
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,400
can only be efficiently
optimized using a GPU

231
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,300
as it is built for this purpose.

232
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,100
Only our third parameter

233
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,600
will be feature engineering well
feature engineering is a process

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,452
of putting the domain knowledge
to reduce the complexity

235
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:31,159
of the data

236
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,600
and make patterns more visible
to learning algorithms.

237
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,152
This process is difficult
and expensive in terms of time

238
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:40,800
and expertise in case
of machine learning.

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,200
Most of the features are needed
to be identified by an expert

240
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
and then hand coded
as per the domain

241
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,100
and the data type.

242
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
For example, the features

243
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,934
can be a pixel value shapes
texture position orientation

244
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:56,700
or anything fine the Performance
of most of the machine

245
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,211
learning algorithm depends

246
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:01,000
on how accurately
the features are identified

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,780
and extracted

248
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,300
whereas in case
of deep learning algorithms

249
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,831
it try to learn high
level features from the data.

250
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:09,400
This is a very distinctive part
of deep learning

251
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,811
which makes it way ahead

252
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,422
of traditional machine learning
deep learning reduces the task

253
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:17,498
of developing new feature
extractor for every problem

254
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,813
like in the case of CN

255
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:22,048
n algorithm it first try
to learn the low-level features

256
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:24,108
of the image such as
edges and lines

257
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:27,000
and then it proceeds
to the parts of faces of people

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,400
and then finally to
the high-level representation

259
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,200
of the face.

260
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
I hope that things
are getting clearer to you.

261
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,582
So let's move on ahead and see
the next parameter.

262
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:38,460
So our next parameter is
problem solving approach

263
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,600
when we are solving

264
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,411
a problem using traditional
machine learning algorithm.

265
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:44,000
It is generally recommended

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,176
that we first break
down the problem

267
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:49,100
into different sub parts
solve them individually

268
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,337
and then finally combine them
to get the desired result.

269
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:55,690
This is how the machine learning
algorithm handles the L'm

270
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,100
on the other hand
the Deep learning algorithm

271
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,800
solves the problem
from end to end.

272
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Let's take an example
to understand this suppose.

273
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
You have a task
of multiple object detection.

274
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,900
And your task is to identify.

275
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,900
What is the object and where it
is present in the image.

276
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,500
So, let's see and compare.

277
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,600
How will you tackle

278
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,035
this issue using the concept
of machine learning

279
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:17,800
and deep learning starting
with machine learning

280
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,143
in a typical machine
learning approach.

281
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:21,512
You would first divide

282
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:24,556
the problem into two step
first object detection

283
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:26,500
and then object recognization.

284
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,400
First of all,

285
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,521
you would use a bounding
box detection algorithm

286
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:33,798
like grab cut for example
to scan through the image

287
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:36,100
and find out all
the possible objects.

288
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,429
Now, once the objects

289
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:41,100
are recognized you would use
object recognization algorithm

290
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,703
like svm with hog
to recognize relevant objects.

291
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,700
Now, finally,

292
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,600
when you combine the result
you would be able to identify.

293
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,704
What is the object

294
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:52,956
and where it is present
in the image on the other hand

295
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:56,700
in deep learning approach you
would do Process from end to end

296
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,300
for example in a euro net

297
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,400
which is a type
of deep learning algorithm.

298
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,100
You would pass an image
and it would give out

299
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,500
the location along
with the name of the object.

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Now, let's move

301
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,281
on to our fifth comparison
parameter its execution time.

302
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:13,628
Usually a deep learning
algorithm takes a long time

303
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:14,700
to train this is

304
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,600
because there's so

305
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,818
many parameter in
a deep learning algorithm

306
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,660
that makes the training longer
than usual the training

307
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,177
might even last for two weeks
or more than that.

308
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,700
If you are training
completely from the scratch,

309
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,000
whereas in the case of machine
learning it relatively takes

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,793
much less time to train ranging
from a few weeks to few Arts.

311
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,555
Now, the execution time
is completely reversed

312
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,600
when it comes to the testing
of data during testing

313
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,800
the Deep learning algorithm
takes much less time to run.

314
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,100
Whereas if you compare it
with a KNN algorithm,

315
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,500
which is a type of machine

316
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,400
learning algorithm the test
time increases as the size

317
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
of the data increase last

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,600
but not the least we
have interpretability as

319
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,700
a factor for comparison
of machine learning

320
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,700
and Running this fact
is the main reason why

321
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,400
deep learning is still
thought ten times

322
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,800
before anyone uses
it in the industry.

323
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,868
Let's take an example suppose.

324
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,800
We use deep learning to give

325
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
automated scoring two essays
the performance it gives

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,499
and scoring is quite excellent

327
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,300
and is near
to the human performance,

328
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,246
but there's an issue with it.

329
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:18,148
It does not reveal white
has given that score

330
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,600
indeed mathematically.

331
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,262
It is possible to find out

332
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:24,581
that which node of a deep
neural network were activated

333
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:25,600
but we don't know

334
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,700
what the neurons
are supposed to model

335
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,300
and what these layers of neuron
we're doing collectively.

336
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,803
So if able to interpret

337
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:35,400
the result on the other
hand machine learning algorithm,

338
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,000
like decision tree gives us
a crisp rule for void chose

339
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,900
and watered chose.

340
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,028
So it is particularly easy
to interpret the reasoning

341
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:45,910
behind therefore the algorithms
like decision tree

342
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,152
and linear or logistic

343
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:50,800
regression are primarily used in
industry for interpretability.

344
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,755
Before we end this session.

345
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:54,174
Let me summarize things

346
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:57,777
for you machine learning uses
algorithm to parse the data

347
00:13:57,777 --> 00:13:59,000
learn from the data

348
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,100
and make informed decision based
on what it has learned fine.

349
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,782
Now this deep learning
structures algorithms

350
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,678
in layers to create
artificial neural network

351
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:09,600
that can learn

352
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,100
and make Intelligent Decisions
on their own finally

353
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,600
deep learning is a subfield
of machine learning

354
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,054
while both fall
