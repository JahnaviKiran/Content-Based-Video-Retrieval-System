1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,320
we hear a lot about how artificial

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,120
intelligence and machine learning are

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,160
going to change the world and how the

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,960
internet of things will make everyone's

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,240
life easier but what's the one thing

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,920
that underpins all of these

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,380
revolutionary Technologies the answer is

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,900
data from social media to the iot

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,240
devices we're generating immeasurable

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,700
amount of data consider the cab service

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,040
provider Uber I'm sure all of you have

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,160
used Uber what do you think makes Uber a

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,860
multi-billion dollar worth company is it

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,260
that availability of cabs or is it their

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,620
service well the answer is data data

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,800
makes them very rich but wait is data

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,559
enough to grow a business of course it

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,780
isn't you must know how to use the data

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,699
to draw useful insights and solve

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,800
problems this is where data science

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,500
comes in in simple words data science is

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,480
the process of using data to find

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,939
Solutions or to predict out comes for a

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,920
problem statement to better understand

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,439
data science let's see how it affects

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,840
our day-to-day activities it's a Monday

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,460
morning and I have to get to office

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,860
before my meeting starts so I quickly

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,960
open up Uber and look for cabs but

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,420
there's something unusual the cab rates

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,700
are comparatively higher at this hour of

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,860
the day why does this happen well

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,840
obviously because Monday mornings are

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
peak hours and everyone is rushing off

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,460
to work the high demand for cabs leads

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,100
to increase in the cab fares we all know

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,259
this but how is all of this implemented

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,960
data science is at the heart of Uber's

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,240
pricing algorithm The Surge pricing

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,400
algorithm ensures that their passengers

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,439
always get a ride when they need one

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,020
even if it comes at the cost of inflated

43
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,840
prices Uber implements data science to

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
find out which neighborhoods will be the

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,860
busiest so that it can activate search

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,020
pricing to get more drivers on the road

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,659
in this manner Uber maximizes the number

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,640
of rides it can provide and hence

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,979
benefit from this Uber search pricing

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,979
algorithm uses data science let's see

51
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,860
how a data science process always begins

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,060
with understanding the business

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,099
requirement or the problem you're trying

54
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,020
to solve in this case the business

55
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,239
requirement is to build a dynamic

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,760
pricing model that takes effect when a

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,860
lot of people in the same area are

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,440
requesting rides at the same time this

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,959
is followed by data collection Uber

60
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,520
collects data such as the weather

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,940
historical data holidays time traffic

62
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,879
pickup and drop location and it keeps a

63
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,220
track of all of this the next stage is

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,980
data cleaning well sometimes unnecessary

65
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,200
data is collected such data only

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,180
increases the complexity of the problem

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,819
an example is Uber might collect

68
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,620
information like the location of

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,019
restaurants and cafes nearby now such

70
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,300
data is not needed to analyze Uber

71
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,640
search pricing therefore such data has

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,220
to be removed at this step data cleaning

73
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,319
is followed by data exploration and

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,319
Analysis the data exploration stage is

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,720
like the brain storming of data analysis

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,700
this is where you understand the

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,220
patterns in your data this is followed

78
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,860
by data modeling the data modeling stage

79
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,780
basically includes building a machine

80
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,000
learning model that predicts the Uber

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,760
search at a given time and location this

82
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,099
model is built by using all the insights

83
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,080
and Trends collected in the exploration

84
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,780
stage the model is trained by feeding a

85
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,000
thousands of customer records so that it

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
can learn to predict the outcome more

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
precisely next is the data validation

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,260
stage now here the model is tested when

89
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,840
a new customer books a ride the data of

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
the new booking is compared with the

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,799
historic data in order to check if there

92
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,599
are any anomalies in the search prices

93
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,599
or any false predictions if any such

94
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,420
anomalies are detected a notification is

95
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,340
immediately sent to the data scientists

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,980
at Uber who fix the issue this is how

97
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,659
Uber predicts the search price for a

98
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,060
given location and time the final stage

99
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,980
of data science is deployment and

100
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,560
optimization so after testing the model

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,840
and improving its efficiency it is

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,420
deployed on all the users at this stage

103
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
customer feed back is received and if

104
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,379
there are any issues they are fixed here

105
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,720
so that was the entire data science

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,180
process now let's look at a few other

107
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,639
applications of data science data

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,680
science is implemented in e-commerce

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,500
platforms like Amazon and Flipkart it is

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,419
also the logic behind Netflix's

111
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,880
recommendation system now when all

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,040
actuality data science has made

113
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,160
remarkable changes in today's market its

114
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,900
applications range from credit card

115
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,479
fraud detection to self-driving cars and

116
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,639
virtual assistants such as Siri and

117
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,060
Alexa let's consider an example suppose

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,580
you look for shoes on Amazon but you do

119
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,680
not buy it then and there now the next

120
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,419
day you're watching videos on YouTube

121
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,880
and suddenly you see an ad for the same

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,759
item you switch to Facebook there also

123
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,100
you see the same ad so how does this

124
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,380
happen well this happens because Google

125
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,300
Tracks your search history and

126
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,280
recommends ads based on your search

127
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,320
history this is one of the coolest

128
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,960
applications of data science in fact 35

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,479
five percent of Amazon's revenue is

130
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,000
generated by product recommendation and

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
the logic behind product recommendation

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
is data science let me tell you another

133
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,440
such story Scott Killen never imagined

134
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,020
his Apple watch might save his life but

135
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,120
that's exactly what happened a few

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
months ago when he had a heart attack in

137
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,259
the middle of the night but how could a

138
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,900
watch detect a heart attack any guesses

139
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,840
well it's data science again Apple used

140
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
data science to build a watch that

141
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,400
monitors an individual's Health this

142
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,860
watch collects data such as the person's

143
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,139
heart rate sleep cycle breathing rate

144
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,320
activity level blood pressure Etc and

145
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,720
keeps a record of these measures 24 bar

146
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,780
7. this collected data is then processed

147
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,759
and analyzed to build a model that

148
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,039
predicts the risk of a heart attack so

149
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,680
these were a few applications now the

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,020
question is how and why you should

151
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,600
become a data scientist according to

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,720
linkedin's March 2019 survey a data

153
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,880
science scientist is the most promising

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,520
job role in the US and it stands at

155
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,979
number one on glassdoor's best jobs of

156
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,800
2019. here are a couple of job trends

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,720
that I collected from LinkedIn top

158
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,120
companies like Microsoft IBM Facebook

159
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,699
and Google have over thousand job

160
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,160
vacancies and this number is only going

161
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,919
to grow similarly these job Trends show

162
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,900
the vacancy of jobs with respect to

163
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,780
geography coming to the salary of a data

164
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,880
scientist the average salary ranges

165
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,979
between a hundred thousand dollars to

166
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,900
hundred and eighty two thousand dollars

167
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,840
now remember that your salary varies on

168
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
your skills your level of experience

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
your geography and the company you're

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,960
working for here are the skills that are

171
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,479
needed to become a data scientist you

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,060
must be skilled in statistics expertise

173
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,220
in programming languages like R and

174
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,919
python is a must you're required to have

175
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,960
a good understanding of processes like

176
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,539
data extraction processing wrangling and

177
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,060
exploration you must also be well versed

178
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,380
with the different types of machine

179
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,560
learning algorithms and how they work

180
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,819
Advanced machine learning Concepts like

181
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,220
deep learning is also needed you must

182
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,440
also possess a good understanding of the

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,419
different big data processing Frameworks

184
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,000
like Hadoop and Spark and finally you

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,979
must know how to visualize the data by

186
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,259
using tools like Tableau and power bi

187
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,539
now that you know what it takes to
