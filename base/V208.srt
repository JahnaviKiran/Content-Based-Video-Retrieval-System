2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,469
as you know we are living in a world of

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,900
humans and machine humans have been

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,609
evolving and learning from the past

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,609
experience for millions of years on the

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,070
other hand the era of machine and robots

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,619
have just begun now you can consider it

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,570
in a way that currently we are living in

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,880
the primitive age of machines while the

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,520
future of machines is enormous and is

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,190
beyond a scope of imagination now in

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,870
today's world these machine or the

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,090
robots have to be programmed before they

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,399
start following your instructions but

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,379
what if the Machine started learning on

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,660
their own from their experience work

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,360
like us feel like us do things more

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,910
accurately than us might even start a

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,160
war of their own now these things sounds

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,230
fascinating and a little scary right

21
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,390
let's just remember this is just the

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,399
beginning of the new era now let's

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,719
suppose one day you went for shopping

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,300
mangoes the vendor had a cart full of

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,188
mangoes from where you could handpick

26
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,650
them weigh them and pay them according

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,720
to the fixed rate now the question

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,060
arises is how will you choose the best

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,189
mangoes you were informed that bright

30
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,020
and yellow mangoes are sweeter than peel

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,390
and the yellow ones so you make a simple

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,340
rule pick only from the bright yellow

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,409
mangoes you check the color of the

34
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,270
mangoes pick the bright yellow ones pay

35
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,790
up and return home right now when you

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,409
went home and tasted all the mangoes

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,390
some of them are not sweet as you

38
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,490
thought you concluded that when it comes

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,829
to shopping them you have to look for

40
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,350
more than just the colors after a lot of

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,210
pondering and tasting different types of

42
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,369
mangoes you concluded that the bigger

43
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,960
and brighter yellow mangoes are

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,060
guaranteed to be sweet while the smaller

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,799
bright yellow mangoes are sweet only

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,350
half the time the next time at the

47
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,270
market you see that your favorite vendor

48
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,790
has gone out of town now you decide to

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,040
buy from a different vendor who supplies

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,659
mangoes born from a different part of

51
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,909
the country now you realize that the

52
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,770
rule which you had learned that the big

53
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,930
red yellow mangoes are the sweetest is

54
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,119
no longer applicable here you made

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,340
another observation here that at this

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,348
particular vendor that soft mangoes are

57
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,540
the juiciest now let's suppose you go

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,620
out with your girlfriend

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,870
and she does not even like mangoes you

60
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,599
know how girlfriends are right and she

61
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,340
would like you to buy oranges for her

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,739
now all your accumulated knowledge of

63
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,629
what man was is worthless at this point

64
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,790
of time now you have to learn everything

65
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,530
about the correlation between the

66
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,810
physical characteristic and the taste of

67
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,879
the oranges by the same method of

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,220
experimentation but then again this is

69
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,709
not as difficult as you thought but what

70
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,110
if you have to write a quote for it so

71
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,150
as humans you would write a chord

72
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,819
something like this if mango is bright

73
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,640
yellow and the size is big that implies

74
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,040
the mango is sweet and if the mango is

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,709
soft that implies the mango is juicy now

76
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,930
conclusion as a human is that every time

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,640
you make a new observation from your

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,010
experiments you have to modify the list

79
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,620
of rules manually you have to understand

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,359
the details of all the factors affecting

81
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,700
the quality of the mangoes if the

82
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,769
problem gets complicated enough it might

83
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,390
get difficult for you to make accurate

84
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,920
rules by hand

85
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,870
that covers all the possible types of

86
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,909
mangoes now this will take a lot of

87
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,280
research and effort and not everyone has

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,650
this amount of time so this is where

89
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,419
machine learning comes into picture

90
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,760
well machine learning is a concept which

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,530
allows the machine to learn from

92
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,139
examples and experience and that too

93
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,629
without being explicitly programmed so

94
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,819
instead of you writing the code what you

95
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,560
do is feed the data to the generic

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,810
algorithm and the algorithm or the

97
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,090
machine will still logic based on the

98
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,370
given data now let's have a look at some

99
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,690
of the features of machine learning

100
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,660
which makes our life much more easier so

101
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,760
what it does is that it uses the data to

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,829
detect patterns in a data set and add

103
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,440
just the program action accordingly it

104
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,030
focuses on the development of the

105
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,829
computer programs that can teach

106
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,930
themselves to grow and change when

107
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,599
exposed to new data it enables computer

108
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,239
to find hidden insights using iterative

109
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,650
algorithm without being explicitly

110
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,199
program so know machine learning plays

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,120
an important role in our day-to-day life

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,879
as well you might not know it but you

113
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,069
are surrounded by a lot of examples of

114
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,079
machine learning and a lot of which is

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,820
something that you cannot live without

116
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,579
for example the first one is Google Maps

117
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,909
now Google Maps is probably the app we

118
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,430
use whenever you go out and require

119
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,330
assistance

120
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,490
in the direction and traffic now the

121
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,960
other day I was traveling to another

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,139
city and took the expressway and the map

123
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,690
suggested despite the heavy traffic you

124
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,000
are on the fastest route but that was

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,770
fine for me but how does it know that

126
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,169
well it's a combination of people

127
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,449
currently using the service the historic

128
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,340
data of the route collected over the

129
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,590
time and few tricks acquired from other

130
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,080
companies now everyone using maps is

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,909
providing their location the average

132
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,740
speed the route in which they are

133
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,389
traveling which in turn has Google

134
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,460
collect massive data about the traffic

135
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,650
which makes them predict the upcoming

136
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,629
traffic and adjusts your route according

137
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,150
to it now another application is the

138
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,039
product recommendation but suppose you

139
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,500
check an item on Amazon but you do not

140
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,479
buy it then and there but the next day

141
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,370
you are watching videos on YouTube and

142
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,680
suddenly you see an ad for the same item

143
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,870
you switch to Facebook chatting with

144
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,729
your friends and there also you see the

145
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,610
same ad so how does this happen well

146
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,039
this happens because Google tracks your

147
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,740
search history I recommends ads based on

148
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,449
your search history this is one of the

149
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,310
coolest application of machine learning

150
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,190
in fact you won't believe that 35% of

151
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,680
Amazon's revenue is generated just only

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,229
by product recommendation well here is

153
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,880
one of the coolest application of

154
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,159
machine learning by far it is here and

155
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,710
people are already using it and that is

156
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,690
the self-driving cars now machine

157
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,219
learning plays an important role in the

158
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,900
self-driving car and I am sure you guys

159
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,270
might have heard about Tesla the leader

160
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,219
in this business and their current

161
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,289
artificial intelligence is driven by the

162
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,690
hardware manufacturer in media which is

163
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,460
based on a type of machine learning

164
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,810
which is the unsupervised learning

165
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,270
algorithm now there are certain steps

166
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,639
which any machine learning algorithm has

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,000
to follow so the first step is data

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,039
collection and this stage involves the

169
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,930
collection of all the relevant data from

170
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,210
various sources now the second step

171
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,860
after collecting all the data is data

172
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,479
wrangling which is the process of

173
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,190
cleaning and converting the raw data

174
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,919
into a format that allows convenient

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,020
consumption now after the data have been

176
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,599
cleaned and converted into a particular

177
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,029
format the data is analyzed to select

178
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,250
and filter the data required to prepare

179
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,349
them all because not all the data is

180
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,210
required for a particular model you have

181
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,980
to select certain features

182
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,600
now after selecting the features the

183
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,250
algorithm is strained on the training

184
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,980
dataset through which the algorithm

185
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,360
understands the pattern and the rules

186
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,940
which govern the data after this the

187
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,950
testing dataset determines the accuracy

188
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,190
of our model and after this F model is

189
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,500
ready so the final stage comes is that

190
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,870
the speed and the accuracy of the model

191
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,180
is acceptable then that model should be

192
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,820
deployed in the real system and after

193
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,740
the model is deployed based upon its

194
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,460
performance

195
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,130
the model is updated and improved and if

196
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,930
there's a dip in the performance the

197
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,540
model is retrained the machine learning

198
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,340
is broadly classified into three major

199
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,680
tasks which are the supervised and super

200
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,930
and the reinforcement learning the

201
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,520
simplest from a machine learning is the

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,890
supervised learning and it is the one

203
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,290
where you have input variables like X

204
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,620
and an output variable Y you use an

205
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,660
algorithm to learn the mapping function

206
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,240
from the input to the output so in

207
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,090
simple terms it implies y equals f of X

208
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,700
now the goal is to approximate the

209
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,490
mapping functions so well that whenever

210
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,980
you get some new input data X the

211
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,720
machine can easily predict the output

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,600
variables Y for the data now let me

213
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,990
rephrase this in simple terms in

214
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,280
supervised machine learning algorithm

215
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,410
every instance of the training data set

216
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,510
consists of input attributes and

217
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,030
expected outputs the training data set

218
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,460
can take any kind of data as input like

219
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,280
values of datasets rows the pixel of an

220
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,650
image or even audio frequency histogram

221
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,080
now let me tell you why this category of

222
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,970
machine learning is termed as supervised

223
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,040
learning now this is because the process

224
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,140
of an algorithm learning from the

225
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,180
training data set can be thought of as

226
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,550
the teacher teaching his students the

227
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,260
algorithm continuously predicts the

228
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,000
result on the basis of the training data

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,460
and is continuously corrected by the

230
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,800
teacher the learning continues until the

231
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,870
algorithm is an acceptable level of

232
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,840
performance now any speech recognition

233
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,299
or any speech automated system on your

234
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,020
mobile phone

235
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,880
trains your voice and then starts

236
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,159
working based on this training data this

237
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,280
is an application of supervised learning

238
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,750
biometric attendance you can train the

239
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,640
machine with inputs of your biometric

240
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,480
identity it can be your thumb your iris

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,029
or your face for the matter of fat once

242
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,740
the machine is trained it can validate

243
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,600
your future input and can easily

244
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,360
identify you nowadays this is being

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,370
implemented in all these smart phones

246
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,589
that we have but sometimes the command

247
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,860
data is unstructured and unlabeled so it

248
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,690
becomes very difficult to classify that

249
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,910
data into different categories so

250
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,040
unsupervised learning helps to solve

251
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,110
this problem now this learning is used

252
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,600
to cluster the input data into classes

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,639
on the basis of the statistical

254
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,130
properties now the training data is a

255
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,959
collection of information without any

256
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,050
label here now mathematically

257
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,399
unsupervised learning is where you only

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,250
have the input data which is the X and

259
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,130
no corresponding output variables now

260
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,019
the goal of the unsupervised learning is

261
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,449
to model the underlying structure or the

262
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,279
distribution in the data in order to

263
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,829
learn more about the data so we came

264
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,720
across in a bottom point here which is

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,209
clustering so what exactly is clustering

266
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,339
so clustering models focus on

267
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,620
identifying groups of similar records

268
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,079
and labeling the records according to

269
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:00,180
the group to which they belong and this

270
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,920
is done without the benefit of prior

271
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,839
knowledge about the groups and their

272
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,449
characteristics in fact we may not even

273
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,790
know exactly how many groups to look for

274
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,920
but the models are often referred to as

275
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,630
unsupervised learning model since there

276
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,610
is no external standard by which to

277
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,380
judge the models classification

278
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,410
performance there are no right or wrong

279
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,380
answers to these models now market

280
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,839
basket analysis is one of the key

281
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,389
techniques used by large retailers to

282
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,660
uncover association between items and it

283
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,029
works all on unsupervised learning

284
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,490
it works by looking for combination of

285
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,829
items that occurred together frequent in

286
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:40,170
the transaction not to put in another

287
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,329
way it allows retailers to identify the

288
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,220
relationships between the items that

289
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,069
people buy for example people who buy

290
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,500
bread also tend to buy butter now the

291
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,389
marketing teams at the retail stores

292
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,459
should target customers who buy bread

293
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,889
and butter and provide an offer to them

294
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,440
so that they buy the third item like an

295
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,510
egg so if a customer buys bread and

296
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,910
butter and sees a discount on or an

297
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,640
offer on egg he will be encouraged to

298
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,920
spend more money and buy the eggs

299
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,170
this is what market basket analysis is

300
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,600
all about the reinforcement learning is

301
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,160
a part of machine learning where and

302
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
agent is put in an environment and he

303
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,170
learns to behave in this environment by

304
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,930
performing certain actions and observing

305
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,089
the rewards which it gets from those

306
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,730
actions this reinforcement learning is

307
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,829
all about taking appropriate action in

308
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,480
order to maximize the reward in a

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,550
particular situation in supervised

310
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,380
learning the training data comprises of

311
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,720
the input and so the model is trained

312
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,690
with the expected output itself but when

313
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,579
it comes to reinforcement learning there

314
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,949
is no expected output the reinforcement

315
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:46,110
agent decides what action to take in

316
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,300
order to perform a given task in the

317
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,430
absence of a training dataset it is

318
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,410
bound to learn from its own experience

319
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,630
now let's understand this reinforcement

320
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,850
learning with an analogy to consider a

321
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,100
scenario where and our baby is learning

322
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,470
how to walk now this scenarios can go in

323
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,170
two ways the first is that the baby

324
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,329
starts walking and makes it to the candy

325
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,550
since the candy is the end hold the baby

326
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,250
is happy it's positive reward now coming

327
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,959
to the second scenario the waving starts

328
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,390
walking but fails due to some harder in

329
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,209
between the baby gets hurt even and does

330
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,699
not get to the candy it's negative the

331
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,190
baby is sad that you implies negative

332
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,529
reward just like how we humans learn

333
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,440
from our mistakes by trial and error

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,760
reinforcement learning is also similar

335
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,190
we have an agent which is here the baby

336
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,290
and we have a reward which is the candy

337
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,720
with many hurdles in between the agent

338
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,459
is supposed to find the best possible

339
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,040
path to reach the reward now another

340
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,930
application of reinforcement learning is

341
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,079
also the games it is used to solve the

342
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,670
different games and sometimes achieve

343
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,040
superhuman performance but the most

344
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,769
famous one must be the alpha go and the

345
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,779
Alpha was zero it trained from the

346
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,850
scratch and a researcher led the new

347
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,160
agent alpha was zero play with itself

348
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,980
and finally beat the alpha go 100 to

349
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,839
zero now this was a major breakthrough

350
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,029
in the reinforcement learning process

351
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,250
and also helped a lot of people in the

352
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,050
deep learning process as well and also

353
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,750
the data scientist to make new robots

354
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,140
and create the artificial parts which

355
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,560
are there in the games so guys this we

356
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,300
come to an end of the session

357
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
I hope you understood the basics of

358
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,530
machine learning what it is what are the

359
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,110
basic types of machine learning how it

360
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,750
is difficult for us to perform all of

361
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,720
these scenarios by hand and write an

362
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,340
algorithm by ourselves

363
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,650
so guys if you have any queries

364
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,300
regarding this session please feel free
