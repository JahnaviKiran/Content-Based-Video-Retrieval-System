1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,159
in this video we are going to learn html

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,160
for new developers now if you missed my

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
last video which is how to set up visual

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,840
studio code um in a professional coding

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
environment and workspace you definitely

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,040
want to watch that that link is in the

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,719
description go ahead watch that and come

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,480
back to here in this video we're going

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
to learn html which is the content for

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,960
the web i'm going to go ahead and close

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
this real quick i can click on this

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
folder thing and get rid of all those

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
files so i have a little more screen to

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,519
work with

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,519
but if you think about a website it's

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
got content and it's got look and feel

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,280
to it so the content would be the words

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
on the page any images on the page any

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
buttons on the page

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
and that those words images and buttons

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,559
could look a thousand different ways

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,960
with a thousand different colors so html

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
is what puts the content on the page um

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
and it's ugly you can tell that this is

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,960
ugly i don't even have a font that's

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
being chosen for me uh let alone a font

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,440
size and a font color or a background

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
color that's because i'm just using html

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
right now i'm just adding content to my

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,879
page after that we'll get into css which

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
is cascading style sheets css would say

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
give me a gray background with blue text

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
and a button with rounded rectangle

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
corners on it and let's make this image

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
small and i don't know let's make it

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
shake when you hover over it things like

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
that that's css and so when people learn

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
html and css together they can build a

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
full website

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
and then javascript is what a developer

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,360
will learn to add functionality to that

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
website where you can maybe post a tweet

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
to twitter and things like that that's

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
all functionality that's javascript so

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,479
those three technologies make a web

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,640
developer's tool kit now what we're

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,759
going to do in this video is we're going

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
to learn html

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
and html is the easiest piece of all

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
three you can really learn it in a day

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
or even an hour because all you have to

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
do is memorize a few words let me show

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,000
you what i mean here i'm going to take

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
away all this code

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
and i'm going to leave that top one

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
there because that's the one that says

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
hey it's an html web page

58
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
everything in html is considered a tag a

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
tag looks like this a greater than

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,719
symbol the tag name we'll call this html

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,878
and then any attributes i'll get to

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,599
attributes in a second and then the less

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,959
than symbol you can see when i type that

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
less than symbol vs code visual studio

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
code automatically added what's called a

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
closing tag for me which is the same

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
thing but it has a slash anything

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
between the opening tag and the closing

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,520
tag is considered inside of a tag so if

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000
i type type type type this is now inside

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
of my html tag and that's how that works

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
you can have tags inside of tags i could

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
have a body inside of the

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
html tag

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
and then i could have other tags inside

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
of that you can have as many tags inside

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
of as many tags as you want it's all

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,519
just tags tags can be two things they

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,360
can have an opening closing

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
or if there's nothing inside of them

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
they can be what's called self-closing

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
which you add a slash to the end of it

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
and a good example of this would be an

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
image an image

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
is the img tag

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
and image doesn't have text inside of it

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
or any of that it loads an image

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
from a web server and spits it out on

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
the page so we don't have to have an

90
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
opening and closing tag it can be self

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
closing

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
and then we define things how does that

93
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
image know which image we're pulling

94
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,680
from the internet we're going to use

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
what's called attributes for that so a

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,159
tag can have one or more attributes to

97
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,159
do an attribute you do a space

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,400
after the tag name and you give it an

99
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,959
attribute let's say it has a width

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,200
width equals 300. and so you do equals

101
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,519
and then an opening closing of

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,280
quotes and then whatever's inside of

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
that is considered the attribute so

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
think of it as a person right the tag

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
name is image let's say this was called

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,760
frank

107
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
and frank has a height well he could

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
have a width too

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
there's attributes about frank right as

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,360
a person he's got a certain height and

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
he's got a certain intelligence

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
these are things that are

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
qualities about frank intelligence high

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
and so that's kind of how tags and

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,040
attributes work the tag is what the

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,159
thing is

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,080
the attributes describe

118
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,040
things about that tag so in this case we

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
have in the case of image we have an

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
image

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
and you might have a height a width and

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a source which is where that image comes

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
from that is all of html we just covered

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
all of html right here tags with tag

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,280
names and attributes that's it from here

126
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
on out you just have to memorize a few

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
tag names

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
and a few attributes and you have all of

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
html done so let's get into some of

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,320
these common tag names there's really

131
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
three categories that give you

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
everything you need to start off to

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
build an html web page you have to have

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
three tags to start off you have to have

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,280
an html tag again i'm just typing html

136
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,520
and hitting tab here and visual studio

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
code is doing the rest so really all you

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
do have to do is memorize some words so

139
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
i'm doing an html tag inside of that i'm

140
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
going to do a head tag

141
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
and then i'm also going to do a body tag

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
those are the three tags that it takes

143
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,639
to build a web page you notice that head

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,759
and body are both inside of html that's

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,840
extremely important

146
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
now html doesn't care about white space

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,160
at all so these could be like this

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
these could be like that it doesn't

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
really matter none of that matters it

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,199
only matters to you the developer we

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,400
like to keep them

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
indented in such a way where it's easy

153
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
to see what's inside of what so that's

154
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,639
what the indentions are all about i

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,600
indent using tab so you can go tab and

156
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
then you can also select one or more

157
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,240
things and do shift tab or tab and

158
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
things will move around indention wise

159
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,080
so that's what those indentions are all

160
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
about

161
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
in our head tag we'll add one title tag

162
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,600
here and let's say my page

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
and let's add an exclamation mark

164
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,720
because we're feeling chirpy today so

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
there we go you can see up here at the

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
top if you can see it because it's

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
really little it says my page

168
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
exclamation mark in the body let's add

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
our hello world back

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,199
and then that is our web page so we've

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,039
got our body our body is everything that

172
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,199
the user sees in this main body of the

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,280
web page so all of the rest of our tags

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
are going to go in here

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
and so that is your basic three tags for

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
a web page html head body and a title

177
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
tag which you don't have to do but

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,080
pretty much everybody wants to do it

179
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
because you want your tab to have a

180
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
title so now let's look into how you

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
style text text comes with

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,120
h1 tag being your biggest piece of text

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
which is a header

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
there you go wow that's really big i'm

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
kind of zoomed in here to make it easier

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
but wow that h1 is big and you can go

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
all the way down to h6

188
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,319
my subtitle

189
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,400
so you notice that h2 is by default a

190
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
little smaller the default css for h1 is

191
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
going to make it huge and h2 is going to

192
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,919
be smaller and smaller still all the way

193
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
down to h6 i'll do an h6 here which is

194
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
even smaller

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
so the h6 is even smaller than and what

196
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
these are used for is these are used for

197
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
telling google

198
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
if you want it to rank your page to rank

199
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
on google and all of the web browsers

200
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
and everything what the most important

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
pieces of your page are so google is

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,199
going to look at your page and it's

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,960
going to say oh the h1 that's the title

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,759
for the whole page h2 these are section

205
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,520
subtitles so any

206
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
content blocks within your page will be

207
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
h2s and farther down if if an h2 has

208
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
multiple content blocks in that those

209
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
will all be h3s that's what we use those

210
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
tags for css could make this one huge

211
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
and make this one tiny so it doesn't

212
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
necessarily relate to size it more

213
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
relates to importance so those are our

214
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,280
h1 h2 those are our header tags

215
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,199
and then there's a p tag which is for a

216
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,039
paragraph hi i'm

217
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,240
a paragraph of text

218
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,160
so there's my paragraph of text and if i

219
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
do multiple ones of these

220
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,919
then you'll notice that each one kind of

221
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
has a space in between it just like you

222
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
would expect a paragraph to do default

223
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
css is going to add a space below each

224
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,199
paragraph

225
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
and so that's how paragraphs work now

226
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
you'll remember i mentioned that html

227
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
does not care about white space so if i

228
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
do a ton of spaces here it doesn't

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
change when i save it nothing is

230
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
different what if i add a million

231
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
returns here well accidentally got a

232
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
slash so we'll get rid of that slash if

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
i had a million returns nothing changes

234
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
html does not care about spaces past one

235
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
the first space works because you know

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,319
you really couldn't type anything

237
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
without a space

238
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
but that's kind of how html works it

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,440
doesn't care about white space white

240
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,760
space is what you use as the developer

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
to make it easy to read all the content

242
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,839
well what if i wanted to add a line

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,760
break like that well there's an actual

244
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,719
tag for a line break called br and it's

245
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
a self-closing tag because it doesn't

246
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
have any content in it and you can see

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
there we go we have an actual line break

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
a return an enter key got added into

249
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
that so that's a tag you want to know as

250
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
well br for line break

251
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
and then what if you want to change some

252
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
of the ways these work

253
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,320
you can add strong to make it bold

254
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
let's make it a strong paragraph added a

255
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,399
space there probably don't need a space

256
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
there strong is basically what you use

257
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
for bold if you're looking at really old

258
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,040
web pages you may see a b tag floating

259
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
around which does the same thing but

260
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
that's that shouldn't be used anymore

261
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
strong is what you should use for bold

262
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,680
now

263
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
and then em is what you use for emphasis

264
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
which is italics you can see there we go

265
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
italics so those are the tags that we

266
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
use for bold and italics strong and em

267
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,600
and we're actually getting a lot of the

268
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,959
way through this list so if you feel

269
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
overwhelmed just remember we only have

270
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
about 12 words we have to memorize html

271
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,760
head title body

272
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
p

273
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
strong em

274
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
and then we also covered our header tags

275
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
and you're almost through basic html

276
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,240
with just those words uh here's a fun

277
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,399
one there's buttons i'm a button

278
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
there we go we have a button looks like

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
i got a typo in there somewhere yep got

280
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
an extra little piece

281
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
and you can click it

282
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
we have a button there no style to it

283
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
but there's a button on the page and the

284
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,480
button also doesn't do anything because

285
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
we don't have any javascript or anything

286
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,079
telling the button what to do but hey

287
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,480
the button is there all the same so

288
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
that's all of our text tags i'm going to

289
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,640
show you two more tags and then we're

290
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
done with basic html we can actually

291
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
start learning basic css from here on

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
out so let's go and add a list tag these

293
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
are actually really important so if i go

294
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,920
li

295
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,959
and say i'm an item

296
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,480
you can see i kind of have a bulleted

297
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
list right there yep i have a bulleted

298
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
list

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
and if i have multiple items i could

300
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
either lay them out like that or i

301
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
should if i have multiple items wrap

302
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
them in a ul which is unordered list and

303
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
now i have to select this and cut it and

304
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,920
paste it because i did it in a weird

305
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
order and you learned to get really good

306
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,279
at those kind of things as a web

307
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,360
developer so i have a ul tag

308
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
with multiple li tags in it this is an

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
unordered list and list items so that's

310
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
what those stand for these would be

311
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
things like a navigation a top

312
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
navigation on your page you will define

313
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
a list of things and then use css to lay

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
them out as a navigation

315
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
you can also change this to o l

316
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
o l

317
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
and you'll make it an ordered list which

318
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,040
is not very useful you don't do this as

319
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
often in html but you can see as soon as

320
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,360
i changed it to ol i got number one

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,399
number two added to my lis but usually

322
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
li and ul is the combination you'll go

323
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
for that creates a list of items and

324
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
then you can use css to style that in a

325
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
way you need to so there you go that's

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,560
it that's all you need to know for html

327
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
it's tags with attributes with tag names

328
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,959
that's html in a nutshell let's start

329
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
building an actual web page with style

330
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,959
and look and feel in the next video

331
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,760
we're going to get into css

332
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,839
you
