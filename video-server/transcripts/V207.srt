1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
hey guys how's it going i'm back here

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,919
with another video and today i decided

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,520
to bring this video which is going to be

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,279
the first video of a new series i'm

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
going to bring here to the channel um

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,800
for the longest time i've been wanting

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,480
to release some sort of

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
beginners to advanced course in react

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
especially because my channel is all

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
based in react however i was really

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,039
wondering if i was going to release it

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
as a paid course or

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,000
just as videos on youtube and for a very

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
long time i was preparing to release it

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
as a paid course however i realized that

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
it doesn't really make sense for me to

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
release it as a big course because i

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
personally don't even use courses never

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
used it in the past and also i feel like

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,559
i can benefit more from releasing it for

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,559
free on youtube because i'll be able to

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,160
grow more of my audience and i'll be

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,520
able to provide this for free for you

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
guys as well so what i decided to do is

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
i decided to release this course where

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
i'm going to be going over everything in

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
react right from the beginning

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,120
right from setting up the react

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,199
application to working with more complex

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,920
projects and more complex topics my goal

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
is that by the end of this course um you

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,479
will be able to confidently create a

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,560
react application and work in it on your

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
own and not only that but also if you

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
have any doubts you will be able to

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
search on the internet to solve whatever

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
doubts you have no one truly knows

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
everything from a language or a

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,600
framework but if you're skilled enough

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
and prepared and you have practiced

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,280
enough on a certain topic you can

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,880
basically tell yourself that you know

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
that because you're able to search and

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
resolve problems on your own and that's

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
my goal with this course i'm not

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
completely sure how many videos this

47
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
course will um

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
will be composed of i have a list of all

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
the topics we're going to be going over

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,119
but um keep in mind that if you guys are

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,560
keep suggesting me stuff that you guys

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
want to learn throughout the way i might

53
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,240
change this list by the end so the

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
topics that we're going to be um

55
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
learning in this course are probably

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,479
showing here in the screen right now um

57
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
as i mentioned uh some of them might

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,479
change i might add more stuff i might

59
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
remove some stuff but those are the ones

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,799
that i i really want to teach because i

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,640
feel like those are the really important

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,799
ones that will set you up for the future

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,479
throughout the course i'll also be

64
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
pointing out other videos that i have

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,160
made in the past because i have already

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,479
made really in-depth tutorials on some

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,640
of these topics so if you're interested

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
in checking those out as well i'll just

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
link to them in the video so you can go

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
ahead and watch them as well now i've

71
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
been releasing videos about once or

72
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
twice a week but because i don't want to

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,560
keep you guys waiting like weeks for

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
this course to be done um i'll try to

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
post

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
as much as possible um probably three

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
plus videos a week um also those v this

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
videos won't take that long to make

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,800
there won't be that long so

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
i'll try to keep them short in order for

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,120
me to be able to post as much as i can

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,040
i'm really excited for this course i

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
really hope it is the best that i can

84
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
provide for you guys and um yeah if you

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
have any any suggestions on what you

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,040
want to learn just leave it in the

87
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,840
comment and um for this first video what

88
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
we're going to be going over is just the

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,879
basics of react um going over why we

90
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,480
should use react why would you want to

91
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
learn react um and also i'm going to

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,480
show you guys how to set up your first

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,360
react application so with that in mind

94
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
let's get into the first video of this

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,210
course

96
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,660
[Music]

97
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,720
[Applause]

98
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,860
[Music]

99
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,640
[Applause]

100
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,879
okay everyone so the first thing i want

101
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
to go over is why exactly you should

102
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
learn react now this is a kind of a

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
trivial question because if you're

104
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
watching these videos um you're probably

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,599
already know why you would want to learn

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
react however you got to understand

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
exactly why it is required for you to

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,120
learn react um in order to improve as a

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
developer or a web developer more

110
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
specifically now the reason why i'm

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
saying this is because i remember in the

112
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
beginning i was really used to just

113
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,440
coding websites using vanilla javascript

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
or some really outdated frameworks such

115
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,239
as jquery and when i started learning

116
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
react i was wondering to myself why am i

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
wasting time learning this when i kind

118
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
of when i can do all of this using some

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
sort of outdated method and that really

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
stunted my my growth uh for a bit it

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
definitely made it so that i took a

122
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,959
little bit longer than um than usual to

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,280
learn the basics of react and for that

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
reason i wanted to start out by just

125
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,238
explaining to you guys why you should

126
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
actually learn react now the first thing

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
i want to say is that you will love

128
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,840
react i'll be honest if this is the

129
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
first framework you're learning i'm not

130
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,639
saying

131
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
react is perfect but i'm just saying if

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
this is the first time you're learning a

133
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
framework and you're coming from just

134
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
knowing vanilla javascript and coding

135
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
websites without using any of the

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
available frameworks out there um i'm

137
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
gonna let you know that you might not

138
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,400
like it in the beginning but you will

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
love it after a while the the the way in

140
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
which using a framework um abstracts

141
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
complexity in your project is is really

142
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
nice i i love it as soon as i realized

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
um how much less code i had to write in

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
order to make a complex website compared

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
to something like using normal

146
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,639
javascript i i really fell in love with

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,639
using something like react now like i

148
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
mentioned react is not the perfect

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
framework at all it is an open source

150
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
library created by facebook and

151
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,560
maintained by a facebook group which

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
constantly deals with

153
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
backlash and opinions from other people

154
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
on how certain things should be handled

155
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
react is constantly updating and

156
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,479
constantly being maintained which is

157
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,960
really nice and has a massive community

158
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
around it everyone knows that react

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
dominates the the javascript um

160
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
framework library

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
industry right and the reason for it is

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
because react right in the beginning

163
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
when it started to be created it came up

164
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
with a concept called the virtual dom

165
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
which um was pretty new at the time you

166
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,600
see angular which is another framework

167
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
um

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
copied or got inspired by this this

169
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,440
concept but i feel like react did it in

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
a better way and was already getting

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
more popular by the time that angular

172
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
released its new version now react

173
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
changed a lot throughout the years you

174
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
might go to youtube and watch a tutorial

175
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
from 2018 and see code that is

176
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
completely different from what it is

177
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,319
right now so it is important for you to

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,400
recognize that the date in which you're

179
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,919
watching your tutorials is really

180
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,680
important now most companies out there

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
will be using react or some sort of

182
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
alternative to react that is based on

183
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
react such as next.js for example um and

184
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,039
that's from my opinion already a really

185
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,319
a pretty good reason for you to start

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,080
learning it because if it is a standard

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
in the industry um and you're gonna be

188
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
working on the industry you better be

189
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
aligned with what people are using and

190
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,440
you'll have a much easier time finding a

191
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
job if you know something that is way

192
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
more popular a lot of the big companies

193
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
out there are using react in some sort

194
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
of part of the application and um it is

195
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
important for you to understand that

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080
it's not only how the framework or

197
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
library performs that makes it good um

198
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
the community and the the amount of

199
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,039
people who embraces that project

200
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,880
definitely plays a role in it and react

201
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,360
definitely wins in that specific case

202
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
now it's hard for me to talk specific

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
things about why you should use react

204
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
because you haven't probably used react

205
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
in the past so explaining stuff that are

206
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,360
more technical is pretty hard so i'm

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,199
gonna be mentioning this kind of stuff

208
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
throughout the course um just so you

209
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,280
guys can refer to that in the beginning

210
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
but for now just understand that react

211
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
is widely used in the world it is it

212
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,599
will make your life way easier when you

213
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,599
start building anything which is a

214
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,520
little bit more complicated than a than

215
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
a medium project and um

216
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
it will make your life easier in the

217
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,759
long run so that's why i think you

218
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
should be learning react now i want to

219
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
go over uh some of the stuff that i'm

220
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
expecting you to know before we get into

221
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,199
the course um so these are the kind of

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
stuff that i will gloss over or not

223
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,199
explain much because

224
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,560
um

225
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
it's assumed that you already know in

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
order to start learning this course now

227
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,759
what i'm assuming is that you already

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
know html and css now i'm also assuming

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,160
that you know a little bit of javascript

230
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
i personally didn't learn um javascript

231
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
before react i knew the basics like

232
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
really basic stuff but i wasn't good at

233
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
it at all so for that reason i am

234
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
assuming you know html css and the

235
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
basics of javascript um because if you

236
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
don't um it will make learning the score

237
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
discourse a little bit difficult um

238
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
however i will still be going over some

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
javascript stuff like um some functions

240
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,400
that we're gonna be consistently using

241
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
um some different methods and concepts

242
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,199
that are important so if this isn't you

243
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
and you don't know the stuff that is

244
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,560
required for this course i recommend

245
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,919
just working a little bit before you

246
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
actually start watching the videos so

247
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
now that i went over all of this stuff

248
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,199
that i really wanted to talk about let's

249
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,680
start with actually working with our

250
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
first piece of code what we're going to

251
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
be doing is we're just going to start by

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
setting up a react application um inside

253
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,240
of our computer and um just looking at

254
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,039
how the project looks so let's get into

255
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,080
it so let's get started on setting up

256
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
our first react application i want to

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
start off by saying that the code for

258
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
every episode in this whole course will

259
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,279
be in the description so if you want to

260
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,519
go to the code for a specific episode

261
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,200
you can just go to the link in the

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
description or you go to the original

263
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
repository on github and just move

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
throughout the different branches that

265
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,680
i'm going to create um for this project

266
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
or this whole course so what we need to

267
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
do in order to set up our first react

268
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,959
application is make sure that we first

269
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
have a code editor to work with i a

270
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
hundred a thousand percent recommend

271
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
using vs code it is pretty much a

272
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,959
standard in the industry and i've tried

273
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
a bunch of editors this one is the best

274
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
one um so i would definitely recommend

275
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,000
using it

276
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
also you need to make sure that you have

277
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,839
both npm which is uh

278
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
one of the most famous package manager

279
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
out there you want to have it installed

280
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
it doesn't have to be this specific

281
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
version this is just the one that i'm

282
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
using and you also need to have node.js

283
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
installed so

284
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
or node installed right so you can see i

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
have both of them installed into my

286
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,040
computer so those are the two things

287
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
that are necessary for you to actually

288
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
create your first react application

289
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
now in order to create your application

290
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
you need to open up a project a folder

291
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,240
inside of your vs code so what i did is

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,000
i just opened over here as you can see i

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
have a folder called

294
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
episode one and i just opened it up

295
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
inside of my vs code um

296
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
like app

297
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,360
and inside of the terminal over here uh

298
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
what i want to do is i just want to run

299
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
the command npx

300
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
create

301
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
react

302
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,680
app like this now what this does is the

303
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
create react app will generate a bowler

304
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
play code for

305
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,720
a very basic react application and we

306
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,920
can specify um where we want to create

307
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
this application by putting for example

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
the name of the folder where our app

309
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,720
will be created right so if i i had a i

310
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
was creating for example a social media

311
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
website i could create put over here

312
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,360
social media website

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
and what would happen is it would create

314
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
a react application and would also

315
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
create a folder called social media

316
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
website and put the create react

317
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
application inside of that folder in our

318
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
case we want to create the react

319
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
application inside of the folder we are

320
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
already inside which is the episode one

321
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
so what we can do in that case is just

322
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
put a dot it doesn't matter what way you

323
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,839
do it

324
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
you can do it both ways i'm going to do

325
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
it this way so that when i press enter

326
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
you'll see that it will start generating

327
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,519
our application and it will generate the

328
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
files inside of the the folder we are

329
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
currently inside

330
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
so it will start um running all of these

331
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,480
commands um and it won't take a while it

332
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
actually doesn't take it takes less than

333
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
a minute but i'll be back in a second

334
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
when this is done okay as you can see um

335
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
it just finished everything you'll

336
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
you'll notice it finished because at the

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
end it will say happy hacking and that's

338
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,839
the the signal that you have that

339
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
everything was installed um correctly

340
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,600
we're gonna clear it up and just close

341
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
our terminal and you can see we have a

342
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
bunch of different folders and files

343
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,959
over here on our left i'm going to go

344
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
over each one of them and explain to you

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,880
guys what they mean so basically we

346
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,560
first have a readme which is just

347
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
something for

348
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,839
github for example uh you i would just

349
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,839
ignore it for now

350
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,279
we also have the git ignore which is

351
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,279
also something for github i would also

352
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,639
just ignore it

353
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,200
then we have our package.json and our

354
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
package lock.json so this comes when you

355
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
install any packages using npn

356
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,639
package.json is just a json file which

357
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,720
contains information about your project

358
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,959
and also about all the dependencies that

359
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,200
you have installed in your application

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,920
so

361
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,079
our project as you can see by default

362
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
its name is episode one because it's the

363
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
name of the folder you can obviously

364
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
change all of this this is more for

365
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
documentation purposes um because for

366
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,959
example if you were to

367
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
create or clone this application

368
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,480
you can just look at all the

369
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
dependencies which are just extra

370
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
packages and libraries you install in

371
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
your project to then know what you need

372
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
to install in your own project so you

373
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
can see we have already with the command

374
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,440
installed the react library and the

375
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,760
react dom library together with all of

376
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,279
the other stuff that comes with this

377
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,320
comment

378
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
now all this stuff over here they're

379
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
meant to

380
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
i wouldn't worry about them for now uh

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
we will go over all of this later but

382
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
for now let's just keep it like this

383
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,519
just understand that this is

384
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
mainly for documentation purposes

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
then i'm also going to ignore the

386
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,959
package.json because it really doesn't

387
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,240
matter for now

388
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,839
and also the node modules because most

389
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,440
of you guys might know this is just a

390
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
folder containing all the packages and

391
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,880
libraries you installed

392
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,720
so we have over here by default in a

393
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
react application our public and our

394
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
source folder our public folder is just

395
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
containing a bunch of um

396
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
kind of static files right so we have an

397
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
a bunch of pictures by default like

398
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
logos that come with the bowler play

399
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
code we also have a bunch of text files

400
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
and json files and also importantly an

401
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,480
html file now why do we have an html

402
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
file over here when we are working with

403
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
a react application we're not going to

404
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,279
be creating html files this is something

405
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
that is really important to understand

406
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,920
because react provides us with a method

407
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
of creating an application which is a

408
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,680
single page application and what does

409
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
that mean exactly it means that our

410
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,079
whole app will exist instead of one

411
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,440
single html file which is the index.html

412
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
so what happens is inside of this file

413
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
over here we're going to have a div as

414
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,480
you can see over here a single div with

415
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,199
an id of root and what react does is

416
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,560
when you are when you enter in the

417
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,519
website react will grab all the code you

418
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,920
write all the react code you write

419
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,399
with javascript and just put everything

420
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,120
inside of this div now why is this good

421
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
well there's benefits and there's

422
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
negatives to it one benefit is that you

423
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
will not need to be downloading more

424
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
files as you move in your application if

425
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
you just have multiple html files for

426
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
each page of your app you need to

427
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,959
download that html file every single

428
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
time you move on your app

429
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,320
but with react that's different

430
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
everything is downloaded before and you

431
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,399
don't need to download and anything more

432
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
when you're navigating right so this is

433
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,920
important to understand because we're

434
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,000
not going to be creating html files but

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
rather our whole app will exist inside

436
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,959
of javascript files which you can see

437
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
over here or typescript files if you're

438
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,680
going to use typescript we're going to

439
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
talk about typescript later on inside of

440
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,959
this course

441
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
but this is how the source folder

442
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,160
basically

443
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240
looks like so we have a couple files

444
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,199
over here we have our test files um our

445
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
setup tests and we also have a report

446
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,199
webvitas.js

447
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
we have a logo which like i mentioned it

448
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,000
just is just coming with the

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
initial boilerplate code we have an

450
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,199
index.js file a

451
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,399
index.css file um a test an app.test.js

452
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,639
file an app.js file and an app.css file

453
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,880
now i want to run this application right

454
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,639
now before we before i go over those

455
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,920
files and before i do anything so you

456
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,639
guys can see how our app looks using the

457
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,279
create react tab command now in order to

458
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
run our first react app i just need to

459
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,759
come over here and i just need to put

460
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
npm start now what this is going to do

461
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,880
is this is going to start running our

462
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,519
application into a live server inside of

463
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,920
our browser the server will run on the

464
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
local host 3000 so make sure you don't

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,480
have anything running on the port 3000

466
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
and every time you make any changes into

467
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
your code and you save the file it will

468
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
automatically refresh and rerun your

469
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
application so it shows the changes so

470
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
i'm going to press enter over here and

471
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
it will start running everything and you

472
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
can see on my browser now i am inside of

473
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,680
the host 3000 this is how our project

474
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
initially looks like because this is how

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,759
it comes with the create react tab

476
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,360
command but we're obviously going to

477
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
make a single change into our project so

478
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
we can show hello world appearing in our

479
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
screen so in order to do that i want to

480
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
come over here and i want to go over uh

481
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
what the files are right

482
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
so some of these files are actually

483
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
unnecessary and i won't even go over

484
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
them right now and that's important for

485
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,199
me to emphasize because if you try to

486
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,639
understand them now it will just waste

487
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,160
your time because you definitely won't

488
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,000
be using them for a while

489
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
in the beginning of your journey for

490
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,480
learning react so i'm going to delete

491
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,199
the setup tests over here the report web

492
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,160
vitals the local.svg

493
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
the index.css

494
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,000
the app.task.js and that's basically it

495
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
so i'm just going to delete them like

496
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,480
this and now it should be fine

497
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,280
now since we deleted the index.css and

498
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
the report web vitals if you recall i

499
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
just deleted those files you also have

500
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
to delete their import statements from

501
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,919
the index.js so i'm going to delete both

502
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,880
of them and this call over here

503
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
and i'm going to save it right now

504
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,679
then i also need to delete the stuff

505
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,320
that we imported in the app.js which is

506
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
the logo

507
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
and i'm just going to delete all of this

508
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
code over here because this is the code

509
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,039
that comes with that makes our website

510
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
appear like it was before right now you

511
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
see it's just a blank page because we

512
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
deleted everything

513
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,240
now what i want to explain to you guys

514
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,120
is that when you have that html file

515
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
over there right we have i mentioned to

516
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,480
you guys that we have the single html

517
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
file

518
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
well inside of the index.js this is

519
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
where we create a react like element a

520
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
route to all of our code and we put it

521
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,039
inside of the element in the html file

522
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
with the id root so you see what it's

523
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
doing over here is it's grabbing this

524
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
div over here and it's putting all of

525
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
our code inside of that div

526
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
now what exactly is it putting inside of

527
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,000
that div well it's going to be putting

528
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,679
this thing over here which is known as a

529
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,360
component i'm going to go over

530
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
components in the next video but think

531
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
about it at this this way all of the

532
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,240
code in your project will initially

533
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,679
exist inside of this app function over

534
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,840
here now i know if this is the first

535
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
time you're looking at react you might

536
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
think this is lit this looks weird

537
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,520
you're creating a function that returns

538
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,840
what looks like html well don't worry

539
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
i'll go over this in the next video but

540
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
for now if we want to display hello

541
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
world inside of our project all we have

542
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,640
to do is just write hello world over

543
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
here save it and if we come to our

544
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,080
google chrome you'll see it says hello

545
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,799
world in our screen so this is basically

546
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
it for the first video i really hope you

547
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
guys enjoyed it if you enjoyed it please

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
i don't want to tailor this just for

554
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,679
beginners just for intermediate or just

555
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
for advanced i want to make something

556
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
that whenever you have any doubts you

557
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
whenever you forget something you just

558
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,039
go back and watch it because each video

559
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,200
can exist not only in in the context of

560
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
the two of the series but also in the

561
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,320
context of the topic itself so i want to

562
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,160
have a library of everything you might

563
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
want to learn about react inside of my

564
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
channel so that's my hope for this

565
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,400
series i hope that you start as a

566
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,120
beginner and you end as good as you can

567
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
be so

568
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
that's basically it really hope you guys

569
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
